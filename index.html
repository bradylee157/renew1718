          <blockquote>Unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</blockquote>
          <cite>John 12:24</cite>
          <p>Jesus speaks of a death in which the kernel is raised to a new, abundant life, while promoting flourishing life around it. That&rsquo;s what we want for ourselves, our church, our city: flourishing life renewed by the Gospel.</p>
          <p><em>Renew</em> seeks to bring the entire congregation into a common experience of the Gospel, such that our personal and corporate renewal spills abundantly into the renewal of Annapolis and the surrounding area.</p>
          <p>We intend <em>Renew</em> to be so formative and foundational in our collective lives that it will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clarify our direction as a Jesus-loving, mission-pursuing church</li>
            <li>Unify the body around a shared mission to reach our city</li>
            <li>Increase stories of personal renewal and transformation</li>
            <li>Lay a foundation for the renewal of Annapolis and the surrounding communities</li>
            <li>Nurture more relationships across more boundaries impacting more lives</li>

            <li>Dive into content <em>and</em> application</li>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Gospel Centrality</h3>
            <p>God&rsquo;s love for his world through his Son Jesus Christ is central to all we do. It gives life to everything else, and without it nothing can be done that is worth doing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Community Through Mission</h3>
            <p>Through focus on God&rsquo;s mission to his world, our common life together is rich, life-changing, and will never stop within its own walls.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Model God&rsquo;s Renewed Family</h3>
            <p>Jesus called his disciples to become a new family, one that transcends racial, generational, social, economic, and political boundaries. These groups seek to model his call. All are welcome.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Interdependence</h3>
            <p>We need each other. Discipleship and mission are not possible without deep connectedness and reliance on others.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Outward Facing</h3>
            <p>We aim to be a place where life-long disciples and non-believers can enjoy one another and find common ground. Renew Groups recognize this and seek the well-being of all.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Open for Processing</h3>
            <p>We seek to help people lovingly yet critically engage with our culture, recognizing our role in shaping it. No one person or demographic has a corner on truth; we must learn, process, and apply together.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>Will <em>Renew</em> continue after our May 20 joint service? And if so, are we going to continue to meet in Renew Groups?</h3>
            <p>Yes and yes! <em>Renew</em> is going to continue beyond the Gospel Transformation series and we desire that our people continue to meet in Renew Groups. We believe that ministry through these small groups is an effective, sustainable way to learn about Jesus, care for one another, and apply to our lives what we’ve heard on Sundays.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>You use the terms small groups and Renew Groups to describe what we’re doing. Are they the same thing?</h3>
            <p>Yes, one and the same! Renew Groups are what we have decided to call our small group ministry, both in light of our mission of seeking the renewal of Annapolis as we are being renewed by the gospel and as a continuation of the work God has been doing in our midst this past year through Renew.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What happens when the summer starts?</h3>
            <p>This has been a big year, so whether you are needing a rest or gearing up for more there is a place for you. Your group has the freedom to keep right on going, to merge or multiply, or to take a break until the fall. (If you do take a break, we still encourage you to get together for a meal or an EP event in the meantime!) The Disciple Making Committee is working with each group leader to help make these decisions. We also know that schedules change, so you are free to sign up for a different group. Registration for the summer opens May 20.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What is the curriculum going to look like?</h3>
            <p>Great question! With over 50 groups and 450 participants, we recognize that answers may look different from group to group and person to person. We have seen tremendous fruit from coordinating the content between sermons and Renew Group discussion, so we will continue to offer that option. Other options will be available based on the needs and focus of each group. The fundamental basis for selecting curriculum is that it be gospel centered and mission focused.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What if I am not in a Renew Group?</h3>
            <p>The invitation is always open for you to enter more deeply into the EP family by considering involvement in a Renew Group. Summer registration for groups opens May 20, and we invite you to use this as an opportunity to connect more fully to the local body of Christ. It is in our Renew Groups that we learn and grow, care for each other, fellowship together, and seek to welcome others into life at EP.</p>

            <h3>Could you remind me, just what exactly is a Renew Group?</h3>
            <p>Renew Groups provide a gospel-renewal experience in the context of outward-focused communities that encourage and equip us to love God, love people, and love Annapolis. A Renew Group is a safe place where you will learn to confess, love, and serve Christ together; study Scripture together; grow in your experience of God’s grace; and increase your passion for making disciples beyond the walls of our church.</p>

            <h3>Who should be involved in a Renew Group?</h3>
            <p>Anyone and everyone! If you attend Worship here at EP on a regular basis, have your children involved in our Student or Children’s Ministry, or have even completed our Membership class, we invite you to enter more deeply into the EP family by stepping into a Renew Group. These small, intentional communities are one of the best ways to mature in your relationship with God and others.</p>

            <h3>What&rsquo;s my commitment?</h3>
            <p>There are two weekly commitments: one, each group will meet once a week; and two, group members will meet one-on-one (face-to-face or virtually) to encourage and exhort each other in learning and application. Of course, regular attendance of Sunday worship remains a pillar of life at EP and is a key component of <em>Renew</em>.</p>

        <h2>Evangelical Presbyterian Church</h2>
        <p>Over the past five decades, EP Church has helped thousands of people in Annapolis and the surrounding area find meaning, purpose, and belonging. With Jesus as Lord, our desire is to be a group of believers renewed by the Gospel who in turn are seeking the renewal of our city and those who live here. The Gospel has changed who we are, and we hope to live out that good news so that others may fall in love with our Savior.</p>

        <p><em>Unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. &ndash;John 12:24</em></p>
        <p>Jesus speaks of a death in which the kernel is raised to a new, abundant life, while promoting flourishing life around it. That&rsquo;s what we want for ourselves, our church, our city: flourishing life renewed by the Gospel.</p>
        <p><em>Renew</em> seeks to bring the entire congregation into a common experience of the Gospel, such that our personal and corporate renewal spills abundantly into the renewal of Annapolis and the surrounding area.</p>
        <p>We intend <em>Renew</em> to be so formative and foundational in our collective lives that it will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarify our direction as a Jesus-loving, mission-pursuing church</li>
          <li>Unify the body around a shared mission to reach our city</li>
          <li>Increase stories of personal renewal and transformation</li>
          <li>Lay a foundation for the renewal of Annapolis and the surrounding communities</li>
          <li>Nurture more relationships across more boundaries impacting more lives</li>

            <blockquote>Renew groups help members to personalize the gospel and . . . take what we learned as a church family to other people and members of the community.</blockquote>
            <cite>Ola Olugbemi</cite>
            <blockquote>I was really challenged to think through how fear runs a lot of my life and . . . it&rsquo;s driven by not truly believing that I am accepted in Christ&mdash;that I am covered and protected and loved by God.</blockquote>
            <cite>Sophie McDowell </cite>
            <blockquote>It&rsquo;s an opportunity to hear what God is saying about our identity, our growth, and our ability to love others well. God can use that to bring that person to the next place he wants them to be.</blockquote>

        <h2>What&rsquo;s New About <em>Renew</em></h2>
        <p><em>Renew</em> is not just another Bible study! In this curriculum, participants will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Move from personal renewal to missional living</li>
          <li>Dive into content <em>and</em> application</li>
          <li>Share life in intergenerational relationships</li>
          <li>Hear Sunday sermons that work done during the week</li>
          <li>Engage in one-on-one discipling relationships to go even deeper</li>
          <li>Facilitate church-wide shift toward missional living</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>We really think that everybody in our church ought to participate in <em>Renew</em>. We want to go through this as a whole congregation, so we are talking about it in the hallway, in our homes, at work and at school. We want to be a place where we are all understanding the Gospel and how it applies to our lives.</blockquote>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What is the Disciple-Making Initiative?</h3>
            <p>EP&rsquo;s ongoing Gospel-renewal experience, <em>Renew</em>, designed to develop the people of EP as Jesus-loving, mission-pursuing disciples. This fall, we invite everyone to join a Renew Group as we work together to begin a movement of Gospel-centered renewal in the greater Annapolis area.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What is a Renew Group?</h3>
            <p>Small, intentional communities, typically 6-12 people, committed to discipling one another and modeling God&rsquo;s family to our city. Groups will meet weekly in homes, the community, and at the church building, working through the <em>Gospel Transformation Series</em> (Serge Curriculum) together.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What is the <em>Gospel Transformation Series </em>(Serge Curriculum)?</h3>
            <p>Not just another Bible study! Our church is strong in teaching and known for head knowledge, but we can improve in transferring that head knowledge to action in the world around us. Serge is a three-book series based on the transformational power of the Gospel to move us from knowledge to personal renewal to missional living.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>Why this initiative, and why now?</h3>
            <p>In the congregational assessment, we as a church body declared that we are unified in our desire to reach new people, form meaningful relationships, and be equipped for ministry and leadership. This initiative seeks to intentionally and strategically call us all into action to do precisely that. Our hope and prayer is that our personal and corporate renewal will then spill abundantly into our homes, communities, and workplaces.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>Our aim is that the entire congregation experience <em>Renew</em> together. Each person will sign up for a Renew Group, which will meet weekly at various times and locations during the week. We hope these groups will become families that explore life and mission together. Moreover, each week Pastor Bruce&rsquo;s sermon will focus on the upcoming lesson&rsquo;s central theme, to help set the stage for in-depth discussions within your groups.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What&rsquo;s my commitment?</h3>
            <p>There are two weekly commitments: one, each group will meet once a week; and two, group members will meet one-on-one (face-to-face or virtually) to encourage and exhort each other in learning and application. Of course, regular attendance of Sunday worship remains a pillar of life at EP and is a key component of <em>Renew</em>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>How do I get involved?</h3>
            <p>Sign-up for all participants will happen this summer, date TBD. We are currently recruiting and developing leaders for Renew Groups. In the meantime, we invite you to join us in prayer for this initiative and the renewal of our church, Annapolis, and the surrounding area.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>How do I become a leader?</h3>
            <p>To become a leader, one needs to have completed at least one book of the <em>Gospel Transformation Series </em>and participate in the leadership training facilitated by the Disciple-Making Committee. The training will focus on helping participants have application- and mission-based discussion. Our goal is to have at least two trained leaders in every group. If you are interested in becoming a leader, contact <a href="mailto:hbctom@gmail.com">Tom Thompson</a> or <a href="mailto:cmullis@epannapolis.org">Cheryl Mullis</a>.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What about the current sermon series on discipleship?</h3>
            <p>The current sermon series certainly has been on discipleship. However, unlike the current sermon series, the new sermon series will directly correlate with each session in the <em>Gospel Transformation</em> books. We want to provide consistent biblical understanding for all of our groups, allowing them to spend more time on personal application.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>How did this initiative come about?</h3>
            <p>The Disciple-Making Initiative is the culmination of two years of prayer, study, and piloting by the session and disciple-making committee, and it answers the priorities that our congregation expressed in our recent congregational survey: reach new people, engage in meaningful relationships, and prepare people for ministry and service.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>When does it start?</h3>
            <p>We will begin <em>Renew </em>on Sunday, September 10, 2017 with Pastor Bruce&rsquo;s first sermon of the <em>Gospel Identity</em> series. Renew Groups will begin with the first lesson that week, though we encourage groups to meet together in the preceding week to share a meal and get to know one another. The initiative will go through the summer of 2018, with a few scheduled breaks built in. A full calendar will be available as we draw closer to launch.</p>
            <p>If you have further questions please direct them to <a href="mailto:hbctom@gmail.com">Tom Thompson</a> or <a href="mailto:cmullis@epannapolis.org">Cheryl Mullis</a>.</p>

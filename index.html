          <blockquote>Unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</blockquote>
          <cite>John 12:24</cite>
          <p>Jesus speaks of a death in which the kernel is raised to a new, abundant life, while promoting flourishing life around it. That&rsquo;s what we want for ourselves, our church, our city: flourishing life renewed by the Gospel.</p>
          <p><em>Renew</em> seeks to bring the entire congregation into a common experience of the Gospel, such that our personal and corporate renewal spills abundantly into the renewal of Annapolis and the surrounding area.</p>
          <p>We intend <em>Renew</em> to be so formative and foundational in our collective lives that it will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clarify our direction as a Jesus-loving, mission-pursuing church</li>
            <li>Unify the body around a shared mission to reach our city</li>
            <li>Increase stories of personal renewal and transformation</li>
            <li>Lay a foundation for the renewal of Annapolis and the surrounding communities</li>
            <li>Nurture more relationships across more boundaries impacting more lives</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Gospel Centrality</h3>
            <p>God&rsquo;s love for his world through his Son Jesus Christ is central to all we do. It gives life to everything else, and without it nothing can be done that is worth doing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Community Through Mission</h3>
            <p>Through focus on God&rsquo;s mission to his world, our common life together is rich, life-changing, and will never stop within its own walls.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Model God&rsquo;s Renewed Family</h3>
            <p>Jesus called his disciples to become a new family, one that transcends racial, generational, social, economic, and political boundaries. These groups seek to model his call. All are welcome.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Interdependence</h3>
            <p>We need each other. Discipleship and mission are not possible without deep connectedness and reliance on others.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Outward Facing</h3>
            <p>We aim to be a place where life-long disciples and non-believers can enjoy one another and find common ground. Renew Groups recognize this and seek the well-being of all.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-4 columns">
            <h3>Open for Processing</h3>
            <p>We seek to help people lovingly yet critically engage with our culture, recognizing our role in shaping it. No one person or demographic has a corner on truth; we must learn, process, and apply together.</p>

            <p>EP&rsquo;s ongoing Gospel-renewal experience, <em>Renew</em>, designed to develop the people of EP as Jesus-loving, mission-pursuing disciples. This fall, we invite everyone to join a Renew Group as we work together to begin a movement of Gospel-centered renewal in the greater Annapolis area.</p>

            <h3>What is a Renew Group?</h3>
            <p>Small, intentional communities, typically 6-12 people, committed to discipling one another and modeling God&rsquo;s family to our city. Groups meet weekly in homes, the community, and at the church building, working through the <em>Gospel Transformation Series</em> (Serge Curriculum) together.</p>

            <h3>What is the <em>Gospel Transformation Series</em> (Serge Curriculum)?</h3>
            <p>Not just another Bible study! Our church is strong in teaching and known for head knowledge, but we can improve in transferring that head knowledge to action in the world around us. <a href="https://serge.org/resources/" target="_blank">Serge</a> a is a three-book series based on the transformational power of the Gospel to move us from knowledge to personal renewal to missional living.</p>

            <h3>Why this initiative, and why now?</h3>
            <p>In the congregational assessment, we as a church body declared that we are unified in our desire to reach new people, form meaningful relationships, and be equipped for ministry and leadership. This initiative seeks to intentionally and strategically call us all into action to do precisely that. Our hope and prayer is that our personal and corporate renewal will then spill abundantly into our homes, communities, and workplaces.</p>

          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>How does it work?</h3>
            <p>Our aim is that the entire congregation experience <em>Renew</em> together. Each person will sign up for a Renew Group, which meet weekly at various times and locations during the week. We hope these groups become families that explore life and mission together. Moreover, each week Pastor Bruce&rsquo;s sermon will focus on the upcoming lesson&rsquo;s central theme, to help set the stage for in-depth discussions within your groups.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>What&rsquo;s my commitment?</h3>
            <p>There are two weekly commitments: one, each group will meet once a week; and two, group members will meet one-on-one (face-to-face or virtually) to encourage and exhort each other in learning and application. Of course, regular attendance of Sunday worship remains a pillar of life at EP and is a key component of <em>Renew</em>.</p>

              <p>Sign-up for all participants will happen this summer beginning July 30. (<a href="#calendar">See the calendar</a>.) We are currently recruiting and developing leaders for Renew Groups. In the meantime, we invite you to join us in prayer for this initiative and the renewal of our church, Annapolis, and the surrounding area.

            <h3>How do I become a leader?</h3>
            <p>To become a leader, one needs to have completed at least one book of the <em>Gospel Transformation Series </em>and participate in the leadership training facilitated by the Disciple-Making Committee. The training will focus on helping participants have application- and mission-based discussion. Our goal is to have at least two trained leaders in every group. If you are interested in becoming a leader, contact <a href="mailto:hbctom@gmail.com">Tom Thompson</a> or <a href="mailto:cmullis@epannapolis.org">Cheryl Mullis</a>.</p>

            <h3>What about the current sermon series on discipleship?</h3>
            <p>The current sermon series certainly has been on discipleship. However, unlike the current sermon series, the new sermon series will directly correlate with each session in the <em>Gospel Transformation</em> books. We want to provide consistent biblical understanding for all of our groups, allowing them to spend more time on personal application.</p>

            <h3>How did this initiative come about?</h3>
            <p>The Disciple-Making Initiative is the culmination of two years of prayer, study, and piloting by the session and disciple-making committee, and it answers the priorities that our congregation expressed in our recent congregational survey: reach new people, engage in meaningful relationships, and prepare people for ministry and service.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
            <h3>When does it start?</h3>
            <p>We started <em>Renew</em> on Sunday, September 10, 2017 with Pastor Bruce&rsquo;s first sermon of the <em>Gospel Identity</em> series. Renew Groups also started the first lesson that week. The initiative will go through the summer of 2018, with a few scheduled breaks built in. A full calendar is available on Sundays or from your Renew Group leader.</p>

        <h2>Evangelical Presbyterian Church</h2>
        <p>Over the past five decades, EP Church has helped thousands of people in Annapolis and the surrounding area find meaning, purpose, and belonging. With Jesus as Lord, our desire is to be a group of believers renewed by the Gospel who in turn are seeking the renewal of our city and those who live here.
